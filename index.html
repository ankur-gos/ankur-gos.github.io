				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>I'm a senior machine learning engineer at Apple, where I currently focus on LLM finetuning to help everyday users complete tasks.</p>

				<p>Before Apple, I was a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I built <a href="https://xdd.wisc.edu/set_visualizer/sets/xdd-covid-19">COSMOS</a>, an ML-powered semantic search engine over scientific documents. My advisor was <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~thodrek/">Theodoros Rekatsinas</a>.</p>

				<p>Outside of work, I enjoy being outside and playing sports, especially volleyball and tennis.</p>

				<h3>Latest</h3>
				<p>Our work on deploying an on-device ANN search library has been published in SIGMOD 2025: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3722212.3724444">MicroNN: An On-device Disk-resident Updatable Vector Database</a></p>
