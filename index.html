				<p>I'm a senior machine learning engineer at Apple, where I currently focus on LLM finetuning to help everyday users complete tasks.</p>

				<p>Before Apple, I was a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I built <a href="https://cosmos.wisc.edu/">COSMOS</a>, an ML-powered semantic search engine over scientific documents. My advisor was <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~thodrek/">Theodoros Rekatsinas</a>.</p>

				<p>Outside of work, I enjoy being outside and playing sports, especially volleyball and tennis.</p>
