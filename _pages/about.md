title: About me
---


I'm a senior machine learning engineer at Apple, where I currently focus on LLM finetuning to help everyday users complete tasks.

Before Apple, I was a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I built [COSMOS](https://cosmos.wisc.edu/), an ML-powered semantic search engine over scientific documents. My advisor was [Theodoros Rekatsinas](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~thodrek/).

Outside of work, I enjoy being outside and playing sports, especially volleyball and tennis.
