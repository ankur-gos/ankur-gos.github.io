title: About me
---


I'm currently a machine learning engineer on the Siri team at Apple. I'm primarily interested in search and information extraction, as well as problems in the knowledge graph world such as entity linking, link prediction, and graph representation learning. Before joining Apple, I was a graduate student
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I built [COSMOS](https://cosmos.wisc.edu/), an ML powered semantic search and analytics engine over scientific documents. My advisor was [Theodoros Rekatsinas](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~thodrek/).
Outside of work, I enjoy being outside and playing sports, especially volleyball and tennis.
